# Part 1 – Grandpa Mode

- I don’t want to live at the keyboard; I want to move systems by talking.  
- My voice does the “manual work”; AI does the heavy lifting.  
- GitHub, Claude, ChatGPT, Samsung devices, and other tools are my basic ecosystem.  
- Two big drivers run everything: **voice time** and **AI mix**.  
- Above that, **structure and philosophy** keep my whole world consistent and growing.  

# Part 2 – System Architect Mode

## 1. Four-Layer Architecture

My whole workflow is stacked into four layers:

1. **Foundation Layer (Tools & Literacy)**  
   - LLM stack: ChatGPT, Claude MCP Desktop, Grok, Gemini.  
   - GitHub ecosystem: repos, PRs, Copilot Space, Copilot Agents as factory workers.  
   - Claude MCP Desktop: powerful, surgical reasoning — but PC-only, not mobile.  
   - Samsung devices: my real studio, where voice becomes action.

2. **Core Drivers Layer (What Actually Moves Things)**  
   - **Voice Time**: my speech is raw material, code, and manual work combined.  
   - **AI Mix**: I combine different models to get structure, ideas, verification, and execution.

3. **Upper Layer (Meta-Skill)**  
   - **Structuring Ability**: the skill of wiring voice → AI → output without losing shape.  
   - **Philosophy**: the “why” that decides constraints, trade-offs, and direction.

4. **EduArt Engineer Lane (Creative Expansion)**  
   - Everything from the Technician layer flows upward into EduArt work:  
     textbooks, drawings, PWA content, YouTube formats, KR Merit worldbuilding, and more.

## 2. The Loop

The life cycle of my work is one continuous loop:

- Foundation → Voice → AI Mix → Structure → Philosophy → Creation → back to Foundation.  
- Every time I speak, the system self-upgrades a little bit more.  

## 3. AI Organization as a Team

I treat each AI as a role in a small company:

- **ChatGPT** → Director of structure & orchestration.  
- **Claude MCP Desktop** → Surgeon for deep reasoning and complex fixes.  
- **Gemini** → Auditor that checks stability and realism.  
- **Grok** → Spark for speed, chaos, and wild ideas.  
- **Copilot Agents** → Workers that actually write code and push changes.

I don’t babysit them; I brief them by voice and let them work.

## 4. Workshop ↔ Factory Boundary

There are two main modes:

- **Workshop Mode (공방)**  
  - Tistory HTML mode, small manual tweaks, impulsive writing and sketching.  
- **Factory Mode (공장)**  
  - GitHub Pages, PWA deployment, automated builds, PR-based iteration.

I move between them.  
That boundary — where some hand-work remains but most is automated — is exactly where “Technician Parksy” lives.

## 5. Core Philosophies (as System Rules)

- **Raw Stone Theory** — spontaneous speech is the raw stone of everything.  
- **Automation Theory** — I aim for 90% system, 10% human touch.  
- **Structure Theory** — structure is what turns noise into a method.  
- **Technician Doctrine** — I use tools aggressively, but I refuse to become one.  
- **Two-Lane Theory** — Lane A (impulse/emotion) and Lane B (structure/brand) spiral together.

## Technician Parksy Whitepaper — Final Edition (EN Ver.)

**Version 1.0**  
**Author: Parksy**  
**Identity: Technician × EduArt Engineer**  
**Method: Voice-Driven Automation**

### 0. Prologue — Why “Technician Parksy”

I don’t want to type.  
I don’t want to push pixels.  
I don’t want to live at a keyboard.

But I *do* want a system that moves the moment I speak.

So I built a rule:

> **“Let my voice do the manual work.  
> Let AI handle the heavy lifting.  
> Let structure hold everything together.”**

This is the birth of **Technician Parksy**.

Not a craftsman (too much hand-work).  
Not a pure engineer (too much coding).  
Not just a creator (too abstract).

A hybrid who runs a full ecosystem by *talking*.

---

### 1. The Framework — Four Layers, One Loop

Everything I do sits on four layers.  
They cycle. They feed each other.  
And that loop is my engine.

---

#### Layer 1 — Foundation (My Base Tools)

##### 1) The LLM Stack

Each model is a “colleague” with a personality:

- **ChatGPT** — structure, clarity, orchestration  
- **Claude MCP Desktop** — surgical precision  
- **Grok** — speed, chaos, creative sparks  
- **Gemini** — conservative validation  

Knowing *who lies, who overthinks, who improvises* is part of my literacy.

##### 2) GitHub Ecosystem

This is not a repository.  
It’s my factory floor.

- **Copilot Space** = project manager  
- **Copilot Agent** = hourly worker  
- **PR / Merge** = manufacturing pipeline

##### 3) Claude MCP Desktop

A monster of capability,  
but immobile — PC-only, desk-only.  
Perfect… and paralyzed.

##### 4) Samsung Mobile/Tablet

My real workstation.  
My real studio.  
The only place where voice = action.

---

#### Layer 2 — Core Drivers (What Actually Moves the System)

Everything boils down to two drivers.  
They’re simple, but they dominate.

##### ⭐ Driver 1 — Voice Time

My voice *is* my manual labor.

- Voice = raw material  
- Voice = code instruction  
- Voice = drafting  
- Voice = production speed  

My work output is literally:  
**“How long did I talk today?”**

##### ⭐ Driver 2 — AI Mix

Not one model.  
The *combination* is the engine.

- ChatGPT → structure  
- Claude → solve  
- Gemini → verify  
- Grok → spin ideas  
- Copilot Agent → execute  

**Voice × AI Mix = my productivity formula.**

---

#### Layer 3 — Upper Layer (My Meta-Skill)

Two forces sit above everything:

##### ⭐ Structuring Ability

The ability to connect voice → AI → output  
without losing coherence.

##### ⭐ Philosophy

The “why” behind every constraint:

- Why voice?  
- Why automation?  
- Why minimal manual work?  
- Why oscillate between workshop and factory?  

This is the layer only I can hold.

---

#### Layer 4 — EduArt Engineer Lane

Everything from the Technician layer (foundation)  
naturally flows upward into the **EduArt Engineer** lane:

- textbooks  
- drawing  
- PWA publishing  
- YouTube formats  
- KR Merit worldbuilding  
- tutorials  
- writing  
- system design

“Technician Parksy” is the root.  
“EduArt Engineer” is the bloom.

---

#### The Loop — My Life Cycle

\`\`\`
Foundation → Voice → AI Mix → Structure → Philosophy → Creation
       ↖———————————————feedback to foundation———————————————↗
\`\`\`

This loop self-upgrades.  
It’s not linear.  
It evolves every time I talk.

---

### 2. Identity of Technician Parksy

#### Technician

I don’t adore hand-work,  
but I respect the 5–10% that keeps me human.

I reduce manual work,  
but I never erase it.

#### System Designer

I treat AI like an orchestra:

- ChatGPT = conductor  
- Claude = surgeon  
- Grok = lightning rod  
- Gemini = auditor  
- Copilot Agent = hands  

And I assign roles with my voice.

#### Oral Creator

I create with breath, rhythm, timing.  
I think out loud.  
My voice is both drafting and operating.

---

### 3. My AI Organization — The 5-Role Team

| Role | AI | Function |
|------|------|---------|
| Director | ChatGPT | structure, formatting, orchestration |
| Surgeon | Claude MCP | final solving, heavy reasoning |
| Auditor | Gemini | stability, validation |
| Spark | Grok | chaos, novelty, speed |
| Worker | Copilot Agent | actual factory labor |

I don’t micromanage.  
I talk; they execute.

---

### 4. Workshop ↔ Factory Model

#### Workshop Mode (Hand Studio)

- Tistory HTML mode  
- quick sketches  
- small manual touches  
- impulsive thinking

#### Factory Mode (Automation Pipeline)

- GitHub Pages  
- PWA deployment  
- auto-rendering  
- PR-driven iteration

I walk between both.  
That boundary is where my craft lives.

---

### 5. My Philosophies

#### 🪨 Raw Stone Theory

**“Spontaneous speech is the raw stone.”**

#### 🏭 Automation Theory

**“I do 10%. The system does 90%.”**

#### 🧱 Structure Theory

**“Structure is the difference between noise and method.”**

#### 🛠 Technician Doctrine

**“Use tools, but don’t become a tool.”**

#### 🔄 Two-Lane Theory

Lane A = impulse, emotion  
Lane B = structure, brand, consistency  
I rotate between them like a spiral staircase.

---

### 6. Final Transition — Technician → EduArt Engineer

What begins as:

- tools  
- LLM literacy  
- GitHub mechanics  
- mobile workflows  
- automation  
- time-drivers  

naturally evolves into:

- system design  
- teaching  
- artistic engineering  
- worldbuilding  
- method writing  
- educational creation  

So:

> **Technician Parksy is the seed whitepaper.  
> EduArt Engineer is the resulting organism.**

The bridge between them?  
**Structure + Philosophy.**
