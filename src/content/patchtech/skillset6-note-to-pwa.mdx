# Part 1 – Grandpa Mode

Imagine you have a small, messy notebook on the kitchen table.  
You scribble ideas, diagrams, and arrows everywhere.

Now imagine that **each page can jump into your phone**  
and become a tiny app you can tap.

- No code on the surface  
- Just your notes, but **cleaned, framed, and tappable**  
- Like a "digital index card" that remembers what you meant

Skillset6 is simply:  

> "How do we turn *one honest note*  
> into *a small, living tool* inside your phone?"

We keep the feeling of handwriting,  
but let the phone handle the boring parts.

# Part 2 – System Architect Mode

Now we switch to system language.

At runtime, one idea travels through this pipeline:

1. **Feed** – You talk, scribble, or type  
   - Source: Samsung Notes, Excalidraw, voice → text  
   - Output: a rough **note blob** (Korean/English 혼합 OK)

2. **Digest** – We normalize it into a **Skillset6 MDX file**
   - Decide the **role** of the note:
     - `qsketch` (quick visual idea)  
     - `penon` (essay / reflection)  
     - `mal` (language / wording)  
     - `patchtech` (how-to / tech notes)  
     - `eml` (emotion mapping)  
     - `phl` (philosophy / theory)
   - Wrap it in our **PWA-ready structure**:

3. **Expression** – Build + Deploy

   * MDX passes through the PWA stack:
     - `React + Vite + MDX + Tailwind + vite-plugin-pwa`
     - GitHub Actions on `main` branch:
       - `npm ci`
       - `npm run build`
       - upload `dist` to GitHub Pages
     - Custom domain: `www.eae.kr`

   * 최종 결과:
     - 모바일에서:
       - 홈 화면에 "EAE" 아이콘
       - Skillset6 리포트가 **책이 아니라 화면**으로 열린다
     - PC에서는:
       - 강의 슬라이드 대신 "한 장짜리 OS 문서"

### Folder perspective

For this report:

* Source MDX:
  - `src/content/patchtech/skillset6-note-to-pwa.mdx`
* It shows up automatically in:
  - `/` (Home: latest posts)
  - `/category/patchtech`
  - `/archive`

No manual routing edits:
**MDX = source of truth.**

# Part 3 – Theory Map (Mermaid)

Now we prove we didn't just make this up.

Skillset6 sits on top of a few big ideas:

<Mermaid>
graph TD
  A[Note] --> B[Externalization]
  B --> C[EduArt Engineer]

  C --> D[Feed]
  C --> E[Digest]
  C --> F[Expression]

  C --> G[McLuhan: Medium is the Message]
  C --> H[Levi-Strauss: Structure]
  C --> I[Foucault: Power / System]

  D --> G
  E --> H
  F --> I
</Mermaid>

* **McLuhan** – the format (PWA page) changes the meaning of the note
* **Levi-Strauss** – we restructure raw life into modules (Skillset6)
* **Foucault** – whoever controls the tools controls the workflow & time

So "Note → PWA Thinking" is not just dev practice.
It's a small **power shift**:
from platform → creator,
from random thought → reusable system.
