# Teacher/Recording Mode Features
# Set to "1" to enable invisible scroll buttons for tablet recording sessions
# This adds two transparent touch zones on the left side for bidirectional auto-scrolling during recordings
# - One button scrolls UP when pressed (top 1/3 to 2/3 of screen)
# - One button scrolls DOWN when pressed (top 1/3 to 2/3 of screen)
# The buttons are completely invisible (opacity-0) unless debug mode is enabled in the component
# VITE_TEACHER_SCROLL=1
