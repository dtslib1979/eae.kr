<OpeningFrame videoId="" title="EduArt Engineer Blueprint — Parksy OS v1" />

# Part 1 – Grandpa Mode

- I am an **EduArt Engineer** – not just a teacher, not just a philosopher, not just a coder.  
- **Edu = replication of learning**, **Art = turning mistakes and fantasy into assets**, **Engineer = system and infra design with industrial efficiency.**  
- My life is split into **three domains** – parksy.kr, eae.kr, dtslib.com – and **orchestrated by multiple AIs** working as a studio team.  
- The goal: **talk once, publish everywhere** – daily voice logs become MDX, PWA pages, YouTube, books, and USB packages.  
- This blueprint is the **v1 operating manual** of that OS.

# Part 2 – System Architect Mode

## 1. Core Definition: Edu · Art · Engineer

- **Education (Edu)**  
  - Role: knowledge replication.  
  - Output: tutorials, whitepapers, PWA lessons, YouTube lectures.  

- **Art (Art)**  
  - Role: fantasy and errors as core assets.  
  - Output: webtoons, essays, worldbuilding, music, visual metaphors (football, vehicles, civilization, etc.).  

- **Engineer (Engineer)**  
  - Role: expressive system and infra designer.  
  - Output: GitHub repos, PWA shells, automation scripts, data and financial structures.  

> One person (Parksy), three functions running in parallel: **teacher, artist, engineer** inside a single OS.

---

## 2. 3 Domains × 3 Devices

- **PARKSY SERIES — parksy.kr (Galaxy S25 Ultra)**  
  - Content: KR & 79’s middle-aged universe, essays, characters, lifestyle.  
  - Keywords: KR Merit, Bluff / Halfblood / Aggro / Shaman, “high-schooler-in-middle-age” language.  
  - Role: emotions, worldbuilding, characters, narrative.  

- **EAE SERIES — eae.kr (Galaxy Tab S9)**  
  - Content: EduArt Engineer curriculum, Skillset6, note/drawing/app-dev tutorials.  
  - Keywords: tablet-first practice, Samsung Notes, Excalidraw, AI drawing, PWA lessons.  
  - Role: learning methods, tool usage, hands-on course hub.  

- **DTSLIB SERIES — dtslib.com (Dell XPS i7)**  
  - Content: data, code, financial structures library.  
  - Keywords: Biz MRT, dtslib1k/2k subject series, Python/Excel automation, standards and specs.  
  - Role: archive for structures, code, and models.  

> Not “three websites” but **three brain lobes**: emotion (parksy), method (eae), structure (dtslib).

---

## 3. Multi-AI Studio: Human × LLM Orchestra

- **ChatGPT – Second Brain & Creative Conductor**  
  - From spontaneous speech to structured MDX, PWA HTML, tutorials, briefs, meta-structures.  

- **Claude – CTO/CFO**  
  - Deep code, MCP orchestration, architecture, financial models, simulations.  

- **Grok – Marketing & Meme Radar**  
  - X/Twitter trends, meme scan, punchy titles, thumbnail copy, campaign hooks.  

- **Parksy – Creator & Director**  
  - Philosophy, emotions, worldbuilding, final verdict on tone, rhythm, direction.  

Flow:

> Parksy throws raw voice logs → ChatGPT structures → Claude systemizes → Grok makes it attractive → infra publishes.

---

## 4. GitHub & PWA Infra – 7 Slot Policy

- **Fixed 7-repo strategy:**
  1. parksy.kr GitHub Pages  
  2. eae.kr GitHub Pages  
  3. dtslib.com GitHub Pages (WordPress business domain archive)  
  4. ML / conversation logs / data backup repo  
  5. Mobile terminal “App Store” repo for cloud apps  
  6. APK wrapping / mobile build repo  
  7. Modeling / boilerplate / PWA test GitHub Pages repo  

- **Policy:**

```ts
const REPO_POLICY = {
  maxSlots: 7,
  expandBeyond7: false,
  philosophy: "Constraints create structure.",
};
```

Limiting slots forces architectural clarity: each repo is a **module in the OS**, not a random folder.

---

## 5. Talk-Driven Creation Loop

**Constraints**

- Parksy hates typing, lives on **voice → text**.  
- Real life: long-term caregiving, food-service work, family duties – energy is fragmented.

**Loop**

1. Voice log on phone.  
 2. STT → messy text.  
 3. ChatGPT → MDX report (title, slug, category, tags).  
 4. GitHub commit → automatic Pages/PWA deploy.  
 5. Reuse on YouTube, blogs, USB packages.  

> OS goal: **“Whenever I talk, my OS updates.”**

---

## 6. Production Loop – Season → Orbit → Unit

- **Season Layer (1–3 months)**  
  - Theme-based: e.g., AI digital drawing × philosophy, KR Merit, classical sensory models.  
  - Output: 1 core whitepaper, 1 flagship PWA, 1 YouTube series.  

- **Orbit Layer (28-module map)**  
  - Custom 28-slot grid for concepts, art experiments, system design, psychology, language, export.  
  - Every artifact must land in exactly one slot (e.g., Concept Station, Emotion Driver, Structural Layer, Metaphor Engine, Export Pack).  

- **Unit Layer (atomic)**  
  - One voice line, one sketch, one webtoon panel, one 10-second short, one code snippet, one music note.  
  - Units aggregate → Orbit → Season → OS.

---

## 7. EduArt Tracks – Notes, Webtoons, AI Modeling

- **Track 1 – Note Method**  
  - Tools: Samsung Notes, tablet, hand drawings, AI assist.  
  - Principle: “One concept per page,” visualized as shapes, icons, arrows.  
  - Every note is a future candidate for webtoon, app, or whitepaper.  

- **Track 2 – Webtoon Narrative**  
  - Flow: unit (icon/character/object) → layout → scene → integrated narrative.  
  - Rule: one concept word per scene; story driven by character emotions (“Why is this guy like that?”).  
  - Goal: turn philosophy and psychology into **visual episodes**.  

- **Track 3 – Personal AI Image Modeling**  
  - Repeated prompts + curated datasets to engrave personal symbols and tastes.  
  - Build a private iconography; analyze relations between symbols via code (Python, etc.) and log on dtslib.com.

---

## 8. Magnetic Capital & Business Pipeline

- **Magnetic Capital**  
  - Power to steal people’s attention and time = core of economic independence.  
  - Driven by: story, language, imagery, music, structural quality.  

- **Target Audience**  
  - High-school and above.  
  - People at least as AI-literate as a ChatGPT paid user; aspirational but not academic.  

- **Pipeline**  
  - YouTube: tutorials, philosophy talks, classical DJ sets, webtoon commentary.  
  - GitHub Pages & PWA: digital books, dashboards, course material.  
  - USB Digital Book Packages: compressed offline editions.  
  - Consulting & Licensing: export the EduArt OS and its patterns as a system.  

> Hypothesis: **a well-organized life log becomes OS = brand = product line.**

---

## 9. Media Pipeline – YouTube × PWA × Art Remix

### YouTube Loop (board-first videos)

- 90% handwriting/visuals, 10% voice.  
- Auto captions via ChatGPT.  
- Shorts: 7–15 seconds; long form: PWA screen recordings.  
- Concept: **“YouTube without having to talk much.”**

### Art Remix Loop (images and video)

1. ChatGPT: conceptual logo/diagram draft.  
2. Gemini: stylistic refinement.  
3. Grok: photoreal / high-impact variant.  
4. ChatGPT: final polish (layout, color, text).  
5. Grok Imagine: 6–7 second looped video.  
6. Upload to YouTube as CDN-style asset.  
7. Consume via URL in MDX/PWA pages.  

> Even one image pipeline per day slowly **expands the visual OS**.

---

## 10. Language Engine – Parksy Grammar

### Principles

- Spoken-first, conversational, but precise.  
- Structure: **adjective → noun → particle → verb → adverb (at the end).**  
- Adverbs = “behavior options” attached at the end of the sentence.

### Adverb Engine

- Examples: slowly, aggressively, improvisationally, softly, in parallel, in hard-mode.  
- Treated like **IT options or plugins** for actions.

### Team-space Adverbs (social distance)

- here, there, far, close.  
- Used as psychological camera moves inside sentences.

### Causal Adverbs → Conjunction Group

- “Why” logic is handled by connection words, not by gimmicky adverbs.

### Negation / Emphasis

- De-emphasized to keep the language clean and structural.

---

## 11. Meta Structures – Emotion, Civilization, Music

### Plutchik-based Emotion Vectors

- 8 basic emotions + ecstasy as uplift.  
- Every genre, image, webtoon, track is tagged by emotional core.  
- Forms the backbone of an AI-driven recommendation system.

### Civilization × IT Ecosystem × Geometry

- Egypt = Apple = circle (wholeness, closed ecosystem).  
- Mesopotamia = Google = square (openness, competition, information).  
- India = Microsoft = triangle (spiritual integration, platform mixing).  
- China = Amazon = pentagon / cross (central platform, balanced expansion).  

Used as a thinking template across **philosophy, design, business, worldbuilding**.

### Environment = Sexual Symbolism

- Closed, safe environments → femininity (stability, standards, forms).  
- Open, exposed environments → masculinity (competition, change, creativity).  
- Explains differences in art, architecture, and mentalities as survival strategies.

### Classical Music Sensory Models

- Countries and composers defined as formulas and sensory tables.  
- Example (Russia):  
  - Russia = (ballet × bipolar intensity) / (Rachmaninoff × Tchaikovsky)  
  - Each sense (sight, smell, taste, touch) mapped to scenes and tracks.  

Trifunction:

- Edu: cultural literacy.  
- Art: sensory narrative.  
- Engineer: tabular structure and formulas.

---

## 12. OS Operating Principles

1. **Constraints create style.**  
   - 7 repos, 3 domains, 28 modules.  

2. **Voice before keyboard.**  
   - Systems must favor speech, not typing.  

3. **AI as band members, not gods.**  
   - ChatGPT, Claude, Grok are departments; Parksy is the director.  

4. **Public publishing over private hoarding.**  
   - GitHub Pages and PWA as primary archive; logs are already works.  

5. **Signature over imitation.**  
   - Borrow concepts, but final wording and rhythm must be unmistakably Parksy.
